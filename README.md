# Google Hash Code Challenge

Team members: Hashim Jacobs and Poulomi Banjaree

### Overview
This program attempts to compute the most optimal solution in finding a combination of pizzas, with various numbers of slices each, that arrives closest to the maximum number of slices allowed.

You'll find that we used two different algorithms: findCombination(A bottom-up dynamic programming solution) and shimmySearch(An iterative solution).
These algorithms can be found in the PizzaEvent class.
